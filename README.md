# Tic-Tac-Toe

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- On the new game screen, whichever mark isn't selected for the first player is automatically assigned to the second player when the game is started.
- The first turn of the first round is always played by whoever is playing as X. For every following round, the first turn alternates between O and X.
- After a round, if the player chooses to quit the game, they should be taken back to the new game menu.
- If the restart icon in the top right is clicked, the "Restart game?" modal should show and allow the player to reset the game or cancel and continue to play.
- **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that it’s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it’s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win
